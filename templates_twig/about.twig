                        I never thought I’d say i would enjoy going to the gym but working with Ian has made me view exercise in a completely different way. It’s been great pushing myself with someone who has a genuine interest in my progress, in a comfortable environment. Each session is different so i never get bored, and Ian is flexible with training times to suit with my busy work schedule. I signed up with the goal of trimming down fat and toning up and i am well on my way with results to make me proud after just 8 weeks! Couldn’t recommend Ian enough!

                        <p>I bought into some personal training sessions with Ian with intention to lose fat percentage and build muscle mass plus generally build my cardio fitness up. The reason I chose Ian was because I knew him for a few years and have seen his work in action with his other clients. I asked of him to create sessions that would be very intense, working on cardio and muscle training without them ever getting boring. He didn’t disappoint. Each session was well thought out and different to the last, resulting in boredom being completely obsolete. They were always challenging but he would never make me do anything he didn’t believe I could do and was highly motivating and energetic to the end of each session. His involved attitude toward your training makes it feel like he truly wants to help you achieve your goals and always makes time for any issues you have. With the personal success I have had through my training with Ian, I would highly recommend him to anyone
